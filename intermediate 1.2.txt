--Data Cleaning and Preparation
--Employee Performance table contains data includes some "dirty data".
--Specifically, the 'Employee_Satisfaction_Score' and 'Manager_Feedback_Score' 
--columns contain some non-numeric values and missing data. 
--These dirty data need to be cleaned first before we do analyses.

--For the Non-Numeric Values in 'Employee_Satisfaction_Score':
UPDATE Employee_Performance 
SET Employee_Satisfaction_Score = NULL

/*The GLOB function sets non-numeric values in 'Employee_Satisfaction_Score' to NULL.*/

--For the Missing Values in 'Manager_Feedback_Score':

with 0 (or any other default value your analysis requires)*/
